## Workshop #1: Decision Making Under Uncertainty for Sustainable Energy Transition (17-19 November 2025, Stanford University, USA)

The workshop will focus on the decision making process under uncertainty for sustainable energy transition, covering topics such as risk management, uncertainty in energy transition, and decision making under uncertainty. Participants will be required to fill out a short survey and watch a preliminary video before the workshop since  we expect interactive discussions and Q&A sessions that centers on the unique challenges and opportunities in the energy transition in Indonesia. 

The instructors will deliver lectures and provide hands-on exercises to help participants understand the decision making process under uncertainty. Each day: 

- one session will be dedicated to lecture and Q&A (09:00 - 10:30 PST)
- one session will be dedicated to either: hands-on exercises or in-depth managerial discussions (11:00 - 12:30 PST)
- one session will be dedicated to collaborations (and optional discussions with teaching assistants) (13:30 - 15:00 PST)

The (tentative) sessions for this workshop are as follows:

1. Introduction to Decision Making Under Uncertainty (17 November 2025)
2. Uncertainty in Energy Transition (18 November 2025)
3. State of the Art and Best Practices from Around the World (19 November 2025)
