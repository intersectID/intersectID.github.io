We charge a registration fee to cover the costs of the conference, including the venue, catering, and other expenses. The fee is also used to cover the costs of the competition.                            Why do we charge a workshop registration fee?                    The workshop is a separate event from the conference. The fee covers the costs of the workshop, including the venue, catering, faculty salary, supplies, and other expenses. A 3-day workshop means we need to rent campus facilities for 3 days, and we need to pay the faculty for 3 days of work. Unfortunately, it is not possible to cover the costs of the workshop with the registration fees. If you affiliated with any of the sponsors, you can get a discount on the workshop fee.                            Do we offer a refund?                    We offer a refund if you cancel your registration before the early bird deadline. After the early bird deadline, the registration fee is non-refundable, unless you are rejected for visa.                            Do we offer a discount for students?                    Yes, we offer a discount for students.                            Do we offer additional discounts for group registrations?

Should you encounter any issues during submission, feel free to reach out to the conference organizers at [intersect.indonesia@gmail.com](mailto:intersect.indonesia@gmail.com){:target=\"_blank\"}.## GuidelinesUpon submission, your manuscript will undergo an initial review for suitability by the conference organizers. It may then be forwarded to two or more program committees for further review, or potentially rejected at this stage. To ensure a smooth review process, kindly adhere to the following guidelines:1. We seek high-quality papers that make significant theoretical and/or practical contributions. Submissions can be literature reviews, research papers, or short communications.2. Papers submitted to INTERSECT 2025 should not be copyrighted, previously accepted, or under review for other journals or conferences.3. Authors are responsible for securing the necessary permissions for any copyrighted material from third parties included in their paper.4. Papers must comply with publication ethics, ensuring they are free from plagiarism. In cases of multiple authors, all must be aware of and agree to the submission.5. The abstract, limited to one paragraph, should avoid formulas and references. It should outline the study's background, research method, and key findings.6. The introduction must highlight the research's background, the existing gap, and study objectives, connecting the paper to relevant literature.7. A literature review can be integrated within the paper, ensuring a clear link to existing research.8. The discussion should interpret results without repeating the findings, relating them to existing literature where appropriate.9. Number all equations for clarity.10. Tables should offer new information, not just repeat text, and be clearly numbered and captioned. Ensure tables are editable and not presented as images.11. Insert figures and tables directly into the paper with clear captions, avoiding placement at the end.12. Manuscripts should not exceed 8 pages, including figures and tables, but excluding references.13. Use [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples){:target=\"_blank\"} style for referencing.14. Avoid footnotes and end-notes.15.

Use the provided templates ([MS Word](/assets/templates/INTERSECT_MSWord_template.docx) and [LaTeX](/assets/templates/INTERSECT-LaTeX-template.zip)) for your manuscript without altering the format and style.## IndexingAll accepted papers will be indexed in Google Scholar and assigned a DOI. Some invited presenters (with already published papers) may be exempted from this requirement and will only present their paper for free (by invitation only) for increased visibility and connect with the audience. We will explicitly state this in the invitation letter.Thank you for your interest in contributing to INTERSECT 2025, and we look forward to your submissions.",
