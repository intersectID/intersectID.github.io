<p><strong>INTERSECT 2024</strong> is an interdisciplinary symposium presenting the brightest minds in academia, research, industry, and policy-making. 
    This year, we are excited to host the event at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, the birthplace of Silicon Valley and the epicenter of technological innovation, although most programs will run virtually on <a href="#important-dates">August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024</a>.
