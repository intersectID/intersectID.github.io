# Joining Us at Stanford

We're excited to welcome you to INTERSECT 2025! Here's everything you need to know to make your trip to Stanford smooth and enjoyable.

## For International Visitors

### Do I Need a Visa?

Most Southeast Asian visitors will need a [**B-1 Business Visa**](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-visitors-for-business/b-1-temporary-business-visitor) to attend INTERSECT 2025. This is the standard visa for conferences, workshops, and professional meetings.

**Good news for some countries:** If you're from Singapore or Brunei, you might be eligible for the [**Visa Waiver Program (ESTA)**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html).

### Need an Invitation Letter?

**Just mention it when you register!** In the [registration form](/registration), there's a field to request an invitation letter. Simply check the box and our team will follow up and send the letter to you directly.

In the case of visa rejection, we will refund the registration fee. We typically process invitation letters within **5-7 business days** after registration.

Unfortunately, we cannot process visa applications for you. Please contact your local embassy for more information.

## Getting to Stanford

### Which Airport Should I Choose?

**From Southeast Asia, you'll likely fly into:**

**San Francisco International (SFO)** - *Most convenient for international flights*, with direct flights from Singapore, and thus the most popular choice for travelers from Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian countries. It is about 45 minutes to Stanford by car/taxi and cost $40-70 by [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) or [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/).

**San Jose International (SJC)** - *Smaller and less crowded* airport at San Jose, with some direct flights from Asia. It is about 30 minutes to Stanford by car/taxi and cost $30-50 by [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) or [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/).

### Getting from Airport to Stanford

The easiest way to get to Stanford is to take a ride-sharing service ([Uber](https://www.uber.com/) or [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/)) from the airport to Stanford. If you need a cheaper option, you can take a taxi or a bus. If you need to coordinate with other attendees, you can split the cost of the ride. We will invite all attendees to a WhatsApp group for easier communication closer to the event.


## Where to Stay

There are many options for staying in Palo Alto (which is a short drive or walking distance from Stanford). Some popular options include:
- [**Sheraton Palo Alto**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a4MkcHy2XKFN4QjU9) - Popular with conference attendees
- [**The Westin Palo Alto**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7mZaFcNZZv4bKhJT8) - Premium option, very close to campus
- [**Stanford Guest House**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5RDVaWogwPDUHbg66) - On campus (limited availability, only available for 2 nights)

More budget-friendly options include:
- **Extended stay hotels** in Mountain View or Santa Clara (15-20 minutes drive)
- **Airbnb** in surrounding neighborhoods
- Consider sharing accommodations with other attendees

We recommend booking your hotel early! Hotels fill up quickly during Stanford events.


## Getting Around

While on campus, you can ride the free [Stanford shuttles](https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite) to get around. Also, it is popular for people to walk around the campus or cycle around. Stanford is a bike-heaven campus, so you can rent a bike from the campus bike rental service.


If you rent a car, you can use many guest parking lots around Stanford. They typically cost $3-4 per hour during the day. If you are a keynote or workshop participants, we will provide a special parking permit that you can use throughout the day (A pass). Parking is also free after 4 PM and weekends.

## What to Pack

November in California is typically sunny, but can feel cold for some people. Please dress accordingly. During daytime, it is typically 15-20째C (60-70째F), but it can be colder at night (10-15째C (50-60째F)). Rains are rare, but we will provide umbrellas for you if it rains. Generally, it is a good idea to bring a light jacket. 

For the conference and workshop registrants, we will provide a badge that you can wear. Please bring it with you when you are on campus.

## Money Matters

All transactions are in US Dollars (USD). In most cases, you do not need cash. However, it is a good idea to have some cash on you for emergencies. Credit cards are widely accepted everywhere. You can use Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other mobile payment services in most places. 

Some notes:
- **ATMs** available on campus and around Palo Alto. You can use your bank's ATM card to withdraw cash.
- **Tipping culture**: 15-20% at restaurants, $1-2 for coffee

## Food & Dining

We will provide lunch, coffee breaks, and dinner for the conference and workshop registrants. Some light breakfast will be provided as well.

That said, Stanford and Palo Alto offer diverse dining options. University Ave, just outside of campus, has many restaurants. Asian cuisine is very popular (Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, etc.). Halal options are also widely available. Vegetarian/vegan friendly options are easy to find.

## Prayer Rooms

Stanford has a few prayer rooms on campus. The biggest musallah is located on the third floor of the [Old Union](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3h64wh55655TmTkZ7) where prayer can be performed throughout the day. We will provide a room for prayer during the conference.

## Internet Connection

Stanford has a free WiFi network called "Stanford Visitor WiFi". You can use it to access the internet on campus. Outside of campus, you can use your mobile data or international roaming. Please check with your provider for US rates.

## Sightseeing

Stanford is a beautiful campus, and there are many things to see and do. Here's a [self-guided tour map of the campus](https://visit.stanford.edu/pdf/explore-campus/general_campus_self-guided_tour_map.pdf).

We also offer various side events and activities for you to enjoy. Please check the [Side Events](programs/#side-events) for more details.
