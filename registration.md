# Registration Fees

We have two types of registration fees: conference registration and executive workshop registration. Each type only covers its own event. If you wish to attend both the conference and the workshop, you need to register for both. Also, note that all fees are in USD and not including accommodation. We will publish a list of hotels and accommodations soon.

## Conference Registration

Conference registration fees are for the conference only (main event at November 20, 2025), full day. It does not include the workshop.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why do we charge a conference registration fee?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">

        <div class="faq-question">Why do we charge a workshop registration fee?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The workshop is a separate event from the conference. The fee covers the costs of the workshop, including the venue, catering, faculty salary, supplies, and other expenses. A 3-day workshop means we need to rent campus facilities for 3 days, and we need to pay the faculty for 3 days of work. Unfortunately, it is not possible to cover the costs of the workshop with the registration fees. If you affiliated with any of the sponsors, you can get a discount on the workshop fee.
